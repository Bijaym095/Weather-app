# Live Search Weather App

This is a weather app that allows users to search for the current temperature, minimum temperature, and maximum temperature of a specific location. The app uses a `Weather API` to fetch weather data based on the user's search query.

## Usage

To use the app, simply enter the name of the location in the search bar. The app will then fetch the weather data using the API and display it on the screen.
